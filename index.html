    <cite>The Left-lane Driving Educational Society has truly made a
        difference in my life. Without it, I may not even be alive
        to pass this testimonial on to you!</cite>

    <cite>The Left-lane Driving Educational Society is truly years
    ahead of its time. This development is the culmination of years of
    research, and yet we have found a way to present it so that even
    the most inexperienced driver can understand. This isn't just a society
    for improving driving, it is an organization with foresight that is changing
    the world, one saved life at a time.</cite>

    <!--Michael, you can put your code for the introduction paragraph,
    the video, and the html for the quiz between these "main" tags.
    feel free to style your divs however you want, just make sure you do
    it in the main.css file I have added in the css subdirectory. There
    should be no problems in Github as long as we both don't edit the exact
    same thing between "pulls" and "push"s -->

    has led to many honked horns and shaken fists when ignored: The left lane
    is a passing lane; don't drive slow there! This video by Vox will explain
    why this rule is so important.</p>
