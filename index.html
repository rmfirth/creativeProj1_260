    <h1>This One Driving Trick Could Save Your Life...</h1>


    <!--Michael, you can put your code for the introduction paragraph,
    the video, and the html for the quiz between these "main" tags.
    feel free to style your divs however you want, just make sure you do
    it in the main.css file I have added in the css subdirectory. There
    should be no problems in Github as long as we both don't edit the exact
    same thing between "pulls" and "push"s -->

<p>Many states have laws dictating the rules of the road. One in particular has led to many honked horns and shaken fists when ignored: The left lane is a passing lane; don't drive slow there! This video by Vox will explain why this rule is so important.</p>
